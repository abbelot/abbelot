# Hi there!

My name is Amanda Bj√∂rk and I'm studying full-stack development at Mittuniversitetet, Sweden.



### About me

Currently while I'm studying I also work as a Biomedical scientist in Link√∂ping where I moved this year.

I would describe myself as hardworking who is eager to constantly learn new things, analytical and very creative.

- I'm currently working on some small projects for my portfolio.
- I'm currently learning React framework.
