### Hi there!

My name is Amanda Bj√∂rk and I'm studying full-stack development at Mittuniversitetet, Sweden.


## About me

Currently while I'm studying I also work as a Biomedical scientist in Kalmar where I've lived for the past 8 years. I moved here to study and have stayed put since I got hired after graduation.

I would describe myself as hardworking who is eager to constantly learn new things.


## Current projects

At the moment we're just starting learning SQL and PHP after 6 months of web design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
